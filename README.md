Distillation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering
We show that the perfectly genuine tripartite EPR steerable assemblage  can be distilled from partially genuine tripartite EPR steerable assemblages. 
In particular, we consider two types of hybrid scenarios- one-sided device-independent (1SDI) scenario (where one observer is untrusted, 
and other two observers are trusted)  and two-sided device-independent (2SDI) scenario (where two observers are untrusted, 
and one observer is trusted). In both the scenarios, we show distillation of perfectly genuine steerable assemblage of 
three-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states or three-qubit W states from many copies of initial partially genuine steerable assemblages 
of the corresponding  states. In each of these cases, we show that at least one copy of the perfectly genuine steerable assemblage can be distilled 
with certainty from infinitely many copies of initial assemblages. In case of finite copies of initial assemblages, 
we quantify the performance of our distillation protocols using the concept of assemblage fidelity.
