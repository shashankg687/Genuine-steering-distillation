	journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
	abstract = {The amount of intrinsic randomness that can be extracted from measurement on quantum systems depends on several factors: notably, the power given to the adversary and the level of characterization of the devices of the authorized partners. After presenting a systematic introduction to these notions, in this paper we work in the class of least adversarial power, which is relevant for assessing setups operated by trusted experimentalists, and compare three levels of characterization of the devices. Many recent studies have focused on the so-called ‘device-independent’ level, in which a lower bound on the amount of intrinsic randomness can be certified without any characterization. The other extreme is the case when all the devices are fully characterized: this ‘tomographic’ level has been known for a long time. We present for this case a systematic and efficient approach to quantifying the amount of intrinsic randomness, and show that setups involving ancil
 las (positive-operator valued measures, pointer measurements) may not be interesting here, insofar as one may extract randomness from the ancilla rather than from the system under study. Finally, we study how much randomness can be obtained in presence of an intermediate level of characterization related to the task of ‘steering’, in which Bobʼs device is fully characterized while Aliceʼs is a black box. We obtain our results here by adapting the NPA hierarchy of semidefinite programs to the steering scenario.

This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to ‘50 years of Bell’s theorem’.}

Contrary to classical randomness, this lack of predictability can not be attributed to ignorance or lack of control. Here we find the optimal method to quantify the amount of local or global randomness that can be extracted in two scenarios: (i) the quantum steering scenario, where two parties measure a bipartite system in an unknown state but one of them does not trust his measurement apparatus, and (ii) the prepare-and-measure scenario, where additionally the quantum state is known. We use our methods to compute the maximal amount of local and global randomness that can be certified by measuring systems subject to noise and losses and show that local randomness can be certified from a single measurement if and only if the detectors used in the test have detection efficiency higher than 50%.}

	title = {Self-testing through {EPR}-steering},
	journal = {New Journal of Physics},
	abstract = {The verification of quantum devices is an important aspect of quantum information, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental implementations of quantum computation and secure communication. Within this, the theory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a level of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified without direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is solely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of verification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In this paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we only have direct access to one part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing via EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between full state tomography and Bell tests. Quantum non-locality implies EPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter,
  but we ask what advantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do partial state tomography? We show that in the case of self-testing a maximally entangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis and better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the other hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to constants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main advantage in self-testing based on EPR-steering could be in the case of self-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may be easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party’s Hilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum system.}

We first explain the basic elements of entanglement theory for two or more particles and then entanglement verification procedures such as Bell inequalities, entanglement witnesses, the determination of nonlinear properties of a quantum state via measurements on several copies, and spin squeezing inequalities. An emphasis is given to the theory and application of entanglement witnesses. We also discuss several experiments, where some of the presented methods have been implemented."

	journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
	abstract = {Quantum steering refers to the non-classical correlations that can be observed between the outcomes of measurements applied on half of an entangled state and the resulting post-measured states that are left with the other party. From an operational point of view, a steering test can be seen as an entanglement test where one of the parties performs uncharacterised measurements. Thus, quantum steering is a form of quantum inseparability that lies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement. Moreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum information protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted. Because of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both theoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an overview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite programming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to address a
  number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and applications. We also give a brief overview of some important results that are not directly related to semidefinite programming. Finally, we make available a collection of semidefinite programming codes that can be used to study the topics discussed in this article.}

Such characteristics of quantum systems not only provide direct applications to quantum information science, but are also conceptually important for distinguishing between quantum and classical resources. While concrete illustrations of steering have been shown in several experiments, quantum steering has not been certified for higher dimensional systems. Here, we introduce a simple method to experimentally certify two different kinds of quantum steering: Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) steering and single-system (SS) steering (i.e., temporal steering), for dimensionality (d) up to d=16. The former reveals the steerability among bipartite systems, whereas the latter manifests itself in single quantum objects. We use multidimensional steering witnesses to verify EPR steering of polarization-entangled pairs and SS steering of single photons. The ratios betw
 een the measured witnesses and the maximum values achieved by classical mimicries are observed to increase with d for both EPR and SS steering. The designed scenario offers a new method to study further the genuine multipartite steering of large dimensionality and potential uses in quantum information processing."

However, the joint probabilities characterizing the measurement outcomes of a Bell test are richer than just the degree of violation of a single Bell inequality. In this work we show how to take this extra information into account in a systematic manner in order to optimally evaluate the randomness that can be certified from non-local correlations. We further show that taking into account the complete set of outcome probabilities is equivalent to optimizing over all possible Bell inequalities, thereby allowing us to determine the optimal Bell inequality for certifying the maximal amount of randomness from a given set of non-local correlations.}

In this work, we consider the classical simulation of local tripartite quantum correlations P among three parties ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/51/36/365304/aaad1fdieqn001.gif] and C .

We present specific examples of genuine superlocality for tripartite correlations derived from three-qubit states. It is arg
 ued that genuine quantumness as captured by the notion of genuine discord is necessary for demonstrating genuine superlocality. Finally, the notions of absolute and genuine superlocality are also defined for multipartite correlations.}

abstract = "Quantumness for a bipartite unsteerable quantum correlation is operationally characterized by the notion of super-unsteerability. Super-unsteerability refers to the requirement of a larger dimension of the random variable that the steering party has to preshare with the party to be steered in the classical simulation protocol to generate an unsteerable correlation than the local Hilbert space dimension of the quantum states (reproducing the given unsteerable correlation) at the steering party’s side. In the present study, this concept of super-unsteerability is generalized by defining the notion of super-bi-unsteerability for tripartite correlations, which is unsteerable across a bipartite cut. Genuine super-bi-unsteerability is defined as the occurrence of super-bi-unsteerability across all possible bipartite cuts. Specific example of genuine super-bi-unsteerability for tripartite correlations has been presented. This study provides a tool to characterize the genuine quantumness of tripartite quantum correlations which are unsteerable across every bipartite cut."
